test data for product attribute extraction, 

you need to create json files for each row with the porduct name as the file name,
you can do this by running the function given by us "create_json_for_test_data.py"

I do not recomend making any changes to the function as making any changes might change the output file or filename,
since we have used this particular functio to create json for our test labes

if any changes are required ping us on our whats app group or email

you need to provide us with a zip file containing all these json file, in total there are 99 files

the descriptions need to converted to a json file in a format like:
{
    "product_name": "Air Force",
    "description": {
        "Color": "charcoal",
        "Size": {
            "US": "9"
        },
        "Material": [
            "Mesh upper",
            "Rubber sole"
        ],
    }
}



submition:
submit us your zip file through our email:
submission can be done any time before the deal like but preferably as soon as possible

good luck
